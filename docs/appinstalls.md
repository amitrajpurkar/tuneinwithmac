### YouTube to the rescue
some googling and trial-error lead me to interesting videos, which actually gave me valuable insight.

 * handy video for first-timers [from Syntax](https://youtu.be/GK7zLYAXdDs?si=lxuplcgV7qE63_Vf)
 * mac keyboard shortcuts [from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650)

**Two key applications setup and configured first**

* Cmd + Space by default starts Spotlight 
* install raycast from it’s website— add link
* next configure the hot key combination to not invoke Spotlight and configure next Raycast to use the same hot keys Cmd + Space 
* next install homebrew.. again from website— add link
* once this is done we can now install remaining applications using raycast and invoke brew from within raycast
* there are two options 
  * start raycast by hot key, type brew install,… and select the formula or cask as needed 
  * alternatively use terminal create a text file listing each cask per line as you want and supply that text file as input to brew on terminal…that way you can install list of apps in one command sequentially
