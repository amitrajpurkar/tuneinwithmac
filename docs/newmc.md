from the initial days ... after purchasing the brand new MacBook Pro

### how to get started with using a Mac
having a brand new Mac, these questions faced me

* how to use app store for installing/ uninstalling software -- does this work like iPad/ iPhone?
* i also tried using downloads from vscode, jetbrains and installing from the installers -- i was not satisfied, was unable to understand how these tools were setup/ configured.

So the burning questions were:
> * now how to do the basic user setup
> * how to install ms-office-like-apps: word, excel, powerpoint
> * how to get basic usage configured
> * what are mac keyboard shortcuts -- **this is absolute must for developer-productivity**
> * [shortcuts from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102650)


### some findings..
> a short comparision with windows <br/>
> Windows explorer == Finder <br/>
> customize the OS, Docking to your taste; Macbook should not look/ work like iPad or iPhone, if you want it to work as a Developers machine. <br/>
> to increase productivity/ to avoid using mouse and maximize keyboard usage, --> default is "Spotlight" <cmd + space> i have now setup raycast <br/>
