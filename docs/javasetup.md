* Eclipse is still good for java coding (more so if you have been using it for 25+ years)
* new developers a good to start with VS Code.. Long time Eclipse users will have rampup time, trying to setup VS Code and have all productivity shortcuts established; this depends on how much time you can devote on coding in your day to day life
* my personal eclipse preference is Spring Tool Suite (i am a certified developer using Spring Framework)
* i also use specific code style templates which are configured in Eclipse preferences -- i typically have the entire development team adher to same code tyle templates to maintain consistency, when developing a wholesome java application for an enterprise --- we are not talking of one time short scripts: there is a distinct difference.
* code style templates are stored in this repository (todo: updates needed !!)
