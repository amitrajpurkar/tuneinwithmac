## how can cloud apps help
with factory settings itself and without any tweaks,
we can work with the brand new machine by connecting to our cloud apps and working from them on the documents or data stored in our cloud storage locations

<br/>
here is what worked so far

* google drive and google docs comes to rescue.. 
* alternatives for "word, excel ppt" == docs, sheets, slides
* internet says, try beautiful.ai as ppt alternative... yet to be researched 
* whatsapp also helped me to switch work between devices and sharing documents
