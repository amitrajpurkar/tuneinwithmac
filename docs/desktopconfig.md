What to look for…

* de-clutter the desktop -- try to have no apps on desktop, to discourage mouse usage
* reduce the contents of dock bar -- 
  * by default ios will pile up lots of apps on the dock -- 
  * this tempts the usage of mouse -- 
  * hence reduce apps from doc to mimimum ; 
  * shrink it down ; 
  * set it for auto-hide ; 
  * position it on the sides 
* customize the Finder app to make it work like windows explorer 
  * set it to open home folder by default
  * have it show path bar and also status bar
  * have it view list instead of default icons
  * reduce the fixed folders on left nav bar to bare minimum as per taste
* maximise keyboard usage **Cmd + Space** is the helper: “Spotlight”
* get alt-tab like windows 
* for any application that is open, **Cmd + ,** <Cmd + comma> opens configuration 
*
