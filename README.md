# tuneinwithmac: Tune in with Mac
<p style="background-color:lightgreen">Developer's journey while trying out/ jumping into a MacBook first time after using Windows/OS for several years</p>

<br/>
from the initial days ... after purchasing the brand new MacBook Pro

### how to get started with using a Mac
having a brand new Mac, these questions faced me

* how to use app store for installing/ uninstalling software -- does this work like iPad/ iPhone?
* i also tried using downloads from vscode, jetbrains and installing from the installers -- i was not satisfied, was unable to understand how these tools were setup/ configured.

So the burning questions were:
> * now how to do the basic user setup
> * how to install ms-office-like-apps: word, excel, powerpoint
> * how to get basic usage configured
> * what are mac keyboard shortcuts -- **this is absolute must for developer-productivity**

here is what worked so far
* google drive and google docs comes to rescue.. 
* word, excel ppt == docs,sheets, slides
* internet says, try beautiful.ai as ppt alternative... to be researched 
* whatsapp is also helping to switch work between devices

### for ios find out how to best setup developer environment
Here is the list of developer tools of my interest 
* java/jdk/ multiple versions -- v21 via brew.. need to check VSCode and gradle wiring
* python 3
* gradle -- done via brew
* nodejs
* system environments for each programing language
* database tiny one SQLite, H2, etc
* minikube
* docker


### YouTube to the rescue
some googling and trial-error lead me to interesting videos, which actually gave me valuable insight.

> a short comparision with windows <br/>
> Windows explorer == Finder <br/>
> customize the OS, Docking to your taste; Macbook should not look/ work like iPad or iPhone, if you want it to work as a Developers machine. <br/>
> to increase productivity/ to avoid using mouse and maximize keyboard usage, --> default is "Spotlight" <cmd + space> <br/>
> Learn Mac Shortcuts
